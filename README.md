# "Hardening" Debian

Converting some of the steps from https://github.com/trimstray/the-practical-linux-hardening-guide to debian

This is meant to be exploratory for the Secure System Admin class at Northwest Missouri State University.
Partially because the instructions are designed for CentOS7, and some instructions downright don't work or are out of date.

This does not seek to be a thorough guide to hardening Linux/Debian; instead it is a way to distribute steps and simplify certain operations.  The steps here may or may not work in later semesters and years.

Organisation is... a work in progress.  

Examples that require a Linux user/username will assume a user named `admin`.  You will need to know the password for both `admin` and `root`
